				<h2> Week 1 </h2>
				<h3>April 8, 2017</h3>
				<section>
					<p>
						I feel like I have acomplished a lot this week. I have gone from a <em> very </em> limited use of the terminal to doing most of the work at school from the command line. I have realized that I retained far more of the pre-work in HTML and CSS than I thought I did. I have successfually been able to help some fellow classmates with problems that further cemented some of the concepts in memory.
					</p>

						On Friday I joind a group of 5 other people to try and tackle one of the first group projects, probably a bit ambitiously. Even though we did not get the Tic Tac Toe game operational, we did learn a tremendous ammount about integrating Git and Github in a team setting. After a few accidental push-to-masters, some confusion with merge conflits, and realizing that you havent been working from the current master I think we learned more about planning and team work than we did getting a functioning product, which I dont think is a bad thing at all.
					</p>
					<p>
						All in all I think week 1 at NSS has pushed me to learn to ask help from peers and realize that even though I know more than I thought I did, there is <em> a lot </em> I dont know. And that the community here is more helpful and inviting than I had expected.
